          <p><strong>OG</strong> (formerly OGaming95) is a professional Brawl Stars player that currently plays for Spacestation Gaming, alongside long time friend Bobby, Jack Chepo and Cryingman. Spacestation's Brawl Stars division is widely considered to be North America's best.
          </p>
          <p>
OG first rose to prominence after recording a world record trophy best, 22,054, which was set thanks to the addition of the newest gamemode at that time, Siege, which was a game mode which you could say added a "high risk high reward" factor to the game.
Though being nothing like showdown, it gave more trophies (generally +8 in mid ranged trophy counts) when winning and took more trophies (generally -6 in mid ranged trophy counts). This made it much easier to gain trophies, which OG took full use of.
			</p>
            <p>
After this world record push, OG started to gain a lot of popularity within the Brawl Stars community. He had already established himself as one of the faces of competitive brawl stars, and things were only going to get better.
He was signed by Tribe Gaming, an organisation owned by YouTuber Chief Pat.
He participated in a number of tournaments, including the Pro Brawl League and DreamHack Dallas, both of which he won under the Tribe banner.
He also participated in a number of North American Brawl Stars Opens, where he played under the name "Sneaky Plantas", a team comprising of OG, Bobby, and Squashy. He and his team were highly successful in this and won a majority of the opens that took place.
			</p>
            <p>
He was signed by Spacestation Gaming alongside Sneaky Plantas teammates Bobby and Squashy after his six month contract with Tribe Gaming ended. Spacestation Gaming attempted to qualify for the Brawl Stars World Championship 2019, but failed to qualify, losing in the finals of the North American Qualifiers to future teammates Jack Chepo, Cryingman, who played as IX Gaming.
He also briefly served as a coach to Spacestation's SEA team for the world cup, where they lost in the first round.
			</p>
            <p>
OG is one of the leading Brawl Stars players in the world, and with the $1,000,000 prize pool for the 2020 World Cup announced, he is determined to come out on top.</p>
